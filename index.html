          <p><span class="description"><strong>Solar energy</strong> is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy including solar water heating, and solar architecture. It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. <strong>Active solar techniques</strong> include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. <strong>Passive solar techniques</strong> include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.</span></p>

          <p><strong>Solar power</strong> is the conversion of renewable energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.</p>
          <img id="solars" src="https://www.reliablecounter.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/solar-energy.jpg"/>

<p><strong>Photovoltaics</strong> were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar electricity has fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems have grown more or less exponentially. Millions of installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations have been and are being built. Solar PV has rapidly become a viable low-carbon technology, and as of <span class="color">2020</span>, provides the cheapest source of electricity in history.</p>

<p>As of <span class="color">2021</span>, solar generates <strong>4%</strong> of the world's electricity, compared to <strong>1%</strong> in <span class="color">2015</span> when the Paris Agreement to limit climate change was signed. Along with onshore wind, the cheapest levelised cost of electricity is utility-scale solar. The International Energy Agency said in <span class="color">2021<span> that under its <i>"Net Zero by <span class="color">2050</span>"</i> scenario solar power would contribute about <strong>20%</strong> of worldwide energy consumption, and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity.</p>

          <p><span class="description"><strong>Solar technologies</strong> are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on the distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than Geothermal power and Tidal power, derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.</p>
<p><u>Active solar techniques</u> use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. <u>Passive solar techniques </u>include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies.</span></p>

          <article class="main-article">
          <p><strong>A photovoltaic system</strong>, also PV system or solar power system, is an electric power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to convert the output from direct to alternating current, as well as mounting, cabling, and other electrical accessories to set up a working system. It may also use a solar tracking system to improve the system's overall performance and include an integrated battery.</p>

<p><strong>PV systems</strong> convert light directly into electricity, they are not to be confused with other solar technologies, such as concentrated solar power or solar thermal, used for heating and cooling. A solar array only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels, the visible part of the PV system, and does not include all the other hardware, often summarized as balance of system (BOS).</p>

<img id="solar-panel"src="https://www.solar-auctions.com/Cms/Files/20149a7c-db47-4365-81b2-1c44d981a6f8"/ alt="Parts of Solar Panel">

<p><strong>PV systems</strong> range from small, rooftop-mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a <u>few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts</u>. Nowadays, most PV systems are grid-connected, while off-grid or stand-alone systems account for a small portion of the market.</p>

<p>Operating silently and without any moving parts or environmental emissions, PV systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation. A rooftop system recoups the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within <u>0.7 to 2 years</u> and produces about <strong>95%</strong> of net clean renewable energy over a <u>30-year service lifetime</u>.</p>

<p>Due to the growth of photovoltaics, prices for <strong>PV systems</strong> have rapidly declined since their introduction. However, they vary by market and the size of the system.  Nowadays, solar PV modules account for <u>less than half of the system's overall cost</u>, leaving the rest to the remaining BOS-components and to soft costs, which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and financing costs.</p>

<h4>Solar Array</h4> 
<img id="solar-array" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.6dc5c26c07ac0efca2ad3873f4827d5d?rik=zyiJYYUZLcxPtg&riu=http%3a%2f%2famazecraze.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f09%2fWhat-is-a-solar-array.jpg&ehk=eF266iZEHyu6HA3WdGOD0eueitOERaqH5s%2biPXr6SUs%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"/>
<p>The building blocks of a photovoltaic system are <strong>solar cells</strong>. A solar cell is the electrical device that can directly convert photons energy into electricity. There are three technological generations of solar cells: <strong><u>the first generation (1G) of crystalline silicon cells (c-Si), the second generation (2G) of thin-film cells (such as CdTe, CIGS, Amorphous Silicon, and GaAs), and the third generation (3G) of organic, dye-sensitized, Perovskite and multijunction cells.</u></strong> Conventional c-Si solar cells, normally wired in series, are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather. The module consists of a tempered glass as cover, a soft and flexible encapsulant, a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant material and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called <strong>solar panel</strong>. A solar array consists of one or many such panels. A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of solar modules. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an inverter to convert the DC power produced by the modules into alternating current that can power lights, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in series to obtain the desired voltage; the individual strings are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in watts. Typical panel ratings range <u><strong>from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts</u></strong>. The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.</p>
<h4>Mounting Parts</h4>
<img id="mounting" src="https://img.archiexpo.fr/images_ae/photo-mg/70009-12135842.jpg"/>
<p>Modules are assembled into arrays on some kind of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack. For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used. Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.</p>
<h4>Cabling Parts</h4>
<img id="cabling" src="https://i2.wp.com/parkedinparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/100W-solar-wiring-diagram-1024x546.jpg"/>
<p>Due to their outdoor usage, solar cables are designed to be resistant against UV radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather. Standards specifying the usage of electrical wiring in PV systems include the <strong>IEC 60364</strong> by <u>the International Electrotechnical Commission.</u></p>
<h4>Tracking System</h4>
<img id="tracker" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bBacyZyfi_Y/UZ8OLHGBifI/AAAAAAAAAHM/raK_3RFIyhE/s1600/solar+tracker.jpg"/>
<p>A solar tracking system tilts a solar panel throughout the day. Depending on the type of tracking system, the panel is either aimed directly at the Sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky. Trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance, increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about <strong>20–25% </strong>for a single axis tracker and about <strong>30% or more</strong> for a dual axis tracker, depending on latitude. Trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly. In diffuse light (i.e. under cloud or fog), tracking has little or no value. Because most concentrated photovoltaics systems are very sensitive to the sunlight's angle, tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day.<strong> Tracking systems</strong> improve performance for two main reasons. First, when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight, it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled. Second, direct light is used more efficiently than angled light.
Trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional, but they can increase viable output by <strong>up to 45%</strong>. Arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers. Considering clouds, and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator, and that the sun sets in the evening, the correct measure of solar power is insolation – <u>the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day</u>. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges <strong>from 2.26 kWh/m2/day in northern climes to 5.61 kWh/m2/day</strong> in the sunniest regions.For large systems, the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity. For very large systems, the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment. Tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration photovoltaic systems. For high-concentration photovoltaic systems, dual axis tracking is a necessity. Pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track.</p>
<h4>Inverter</h4>
<img id="inverter" src="https://deltapower.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Which-inverter-is-best-for-the-solar-system.jpg"/>
<p>Systems designed to deliver alternating current (AC), such as grid-connected applications need an <strong>inverter</strong> to convert the direct current (DC) from the solar modules to AC. Grid connected inverters must supply AC electricity in sinusoidal form, synchronized to the grid frequency, limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off. Islanding inverters need only produce regulated voltages and frequencies in a sinusoidal waveshape as no synchronisation or co-ordination with grid supplies is required.<strong>A solar inverter</strong> may connect to a string of solar panels. In some installations a solar micro-inverter is connected at each solar panel. For safety reasons a circuit breaker is provided both on the AC and DC side to enable maintenance. AC output may be connected through an electricity meter into the public grid. The number of modules in the system determines the total DC watts capable of being generated by the solar array; however, the inverter ultimately governs the amount of AC watts that can be distributed for consumption.</p>
<p><u>Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)</u> is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array. In order to do so, the inverter's MPPT system digitally samples the solar array's ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal maximum power point.</p>
<p><u>Anti-islanding</u> is a protection mechanism to immediately shut down the inverter, preventing it from generating AC power when the connection to the load no longer exists. This happens, for example, in the case of a blackout. Without this protection, the supply line would become an "island" with power surrounded by a "sea" of unpowered lines, as the solar array continues to deliver DC power during the power outage. Islanding is a hazard to utility workers, who may not realize that an AC circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices.</p>
<h4>Battery</h4>
<img id="battery" src="https://www.kunini.com/wp-content/uploads/DF_banthula_battery_bank.jpg"/> 
<p>Although still expensive, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage also stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads, and play an important role in a smart grid, as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high.
Common <strong>battery technologies</strong> used in today's PV systems include the valve regulated lead-acid battery– a modified version of the conventional lead–acid battery – nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries. PV systems with an integrated battery solution also need a charge controller, as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging. Basic charge controllers may simply turn the PV panels on and off, or may meter out pulses of energy as needed, a strategy called <u>PWM or pulse-width modulation</u>.</p>
<h4>Monitoring and Metering Systems</h4>
<img id="monitor-meter" src="https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2012/01/pt_407.jpg"/>
<p><strong>The metering</strong> must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions, or two meters must be used. Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid. <u>Frequency and a voltage</u> monitor with disconnection of all phases is required in solar power and it is being generated so that can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or stored. <u>With variable renewable energy</u>, storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever needed. The two variables a grid operator has are storing electricity for when it is needed, or transmitting it to where it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over <strong>30kWp</strong> can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. <strong>Photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize operation</strong>. There are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software. Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent smart meters may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter (a pyranometer) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison. Data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over <u>the World Wide Web</u>, such as <i>OSOTF</i>.</p>

          <article class="main-article">
          <img class="cost" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.e52880dd3f79c92b2fb38c6026b475f1?rik=yGtFhTt3ZRDukw&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" />
          <p>The cost of producing photovoltaic cells has dropped because of economies of scale in production and technological advances in manufacturing. For large-scale installations, <strong>prices below $1.00 per watt were common by 2012.</strong> <u>A price decrease of 50% had been achieved in Europe from 2006 to 2011 and there is a potential to lower the generation cost by 50% by 2020.</u> Crystal silicon solar cells have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells, and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed at lower costs of production. Although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline <i>"siwafers"</i>, they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs</p>
          <p><strong>Photovoltaic panel</strong> prices can depend on your home’s average electricity consumption and system size. The most common photovoltaic system size is a <u>4kW system and costs roughly <strong>£6,000 to £8,000</strong>.</u> To get a better understanding of what the specific photovoltaic panel prices for your home will be, you first need to determine how big of a system you need.</p>
          <ul><h4>Cost Advantages of Investing in PV Panels</h4>
            <li>Large systems will produce excess energy that you can sell back to the grid to generate profit, thanks to the <strong>Smart Export Guarantee (SEG)</strong>. Alternatively you can purchase a solar battery storage system to store that surplus electricity. With a decline in solar battery storage system costs, the investment will be paid off in a shorter period than before.</li>
            <li>After the initial investment, you will not need to spend any more money on the system, since <u>solar panel cleaning and maintenance is so simple.</u></li>
            <li>The lifespan of photovoltaic panels is very long. <strong>They are guaranteed to work (hence to maintain at least 80% of their efficiency) for 25 years, but the average lifespan is between 25-30 years.</strong></li>
            <li>Larger systems, such as a <u>5kW solar panel system or a 6kW solar panel system</u> generally have a shorter payback time and offer more value for money: the bigger the system, the lower the price per watt will be.</li>
            <li>Small and mid-range solar systems will produce a certain percentage of the electricity you need and lead to huge savings on energy bills. <u>With a 3kW system you can expect annual savings of £160 on your electricity bills.</u> With large PV systems, you can become completely independent from the grid and generate all the power you need, and more.</li>
